# Python Course  
## _From the basics to the Object Oriented Programming and more, with examples_

All the exercises will be available on:  
![Google Drive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Drive-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googledrive&logoColor=white)

And all the code is written using:  
![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)

This repository is created for people (students or self-taught) that want to know the basics of programming in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54).

## Topics

Here is an index of the topics covered (inspired by <https://roadmap.sh/python/>):

### Basics

- The Wh questions on python
	- **Why?** Because of its flexybility python can be used in every field you may need: from the simplest programs to data science and machine learning.
	- **What?** Python is a programming language born in the '90, but became populare only later. It's an **interpreted** language, which means that an intepreter (embedded with python installation packages) will "read" line by line the code and execute it, it's very easy to understand and use and can be the basis for learning any other programming language.
	- **Where?** Python programs can be developed from the embedded IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) which is IDLE or, as in this course, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
	- **How?** By the end of this course you will have an understanding of what means programming and some little project built with step by step guides.
- Variables and data types
	**What is a variable?** Let's think it as a drawer (_our variable_), wich has a label on it (_the variable name_), in this drawer you can put "things" (_our information_) and unless you remove the things from the drawer they will stay in it.
	Getting it real a **variable** is a space area in our computer where we can store information useful to our program.
	In Python the syntax to create a variable is:

```python
x=1
```

- Lists, Dictionaries
- Casting
- Conditional
- Functions
- Recursion

### Object Oriented programming

- What is an object?
- Object vs Instance
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Methods

### Data structures and algorithms

- Linked lists
- Heaps, Stacks, Queues
- Trees (and Binary-trees)
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble-sort, merge-sort, insertion-sort)

### Graphic User Interface

### Frameworks

## Links
