# Python Course

## _From the basics to the Object Oriented Programming and more, with examples_

All the exercises will be available on:

![Google Drive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Drive-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googledrive&logoColor=white)

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)

And all the code is written using:

![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)

This repository is created for people (students or self-taught) that want to know the basics of programming in ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue).

## Topics

Here is an index of the topics covered (inspired by <https://roadmap.sh/python/>):

### Basics

#### Wh questions on python

- **Why?** Because of its flexybility python can be used in every field you may need: from the simplest programs to data science and machine learning.

- **What?** Python is a programming language born in the '90s, but became popular only later. It's an **interpreted** language, which means that an intepreter (embedded with python installation packages) will "read" line by line the code and execute it, it's very easy to understand and use and can be the basis to learn any other programming language.

- **Where?** Python programs can be developed from the embedded IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) which is IDLE or, as in this course, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **How?** By the end of this course you will have an understanding of what programming means and some little project built with step-by-step guides.

#### Variables and data types

 **What is a variable?** Let's think it as a drawer (_our variable_), which has a label on it (_the variable name_), in this drawer you can put "things" (_our information_) and unless you remove the things from the drawer they will stay in it.

 Making it real a **variable** is a space area in our computer where we can store information useful to our program.

 In Python the syntax to create a variable is:

 ```python

 x=1

 ```

 Our variables can be defined as some data-types. We can divide the data-types in two big categories:

 **Primitive.** These data-type are the fundamental ones they are **integer** (which defines all the integer numbers), **float** (which defines floating point numbers), **complex** (which defines complex numbers, with j as the imaginary part), **boolean** (which defines 0 [false] or 1 [true] values used for logical and boolean operations), **str** (which defines all the text types).

 Here a list of how to define every data-type seen above:

 ```python

 x=int(255)  #integer

 x=float(1.00)  #floating point

 w=complex(5+3j)  #complex

 x=bool(true) #boolean

 x=str('this is a string')  #text (or string)

 ```

> Note that this **is not** a necessary operation, in fact Python can
> use variables without assigning them a specific data-type.  Although
> is necessary in some cases.

#### Lists, Dictionaries

Using a variable we can store only 1 information at time, there are some structures in Python that allows us to store multiple information, these strcuctures are called **lists**, here is the syntax to create one

```python
    list1=["item1", "item2", "item3"] #string list
    list_int=[1,2,3,4,5,6] #int list
```  

> As you can se it's like creating a variable but we have to use the
> square brackets **[]** to define the elements separated from the comma
> **,**  

A list has these 3 characteristics:

#### Casting

A fatal operation in programming is **casting**, what does that mean? It means to force a data-type into another one, let me explain...
Imagine having a division between to float values and you want only to have the integer value of the quotient, here is how you do that!

 ```python
 x=float(250)
 y=float(256)
 div=int(x/y)

 ```

> Note that you **cannot** cast a data-type into any other one, for some
> data-types you need some **functions** (_like parsing_).

#### Conditional

#### Strings

#### Functions

#### Recursion

### Object Oriented programming

#### What is an object?

#### Object vs Instance

#### Classes

#### Inheritance

#### Methods

### Data structures and algorithms

#### Linked lists

#### Heaps, Stacks, Queues

#### Trees (and Binary-trees)

#### Sorting algorithms (Bubble-sort, merge-sort, insertion-sort)

### Graphic User Interface

### Frameworks

## Links

## Installation

For the installation I recommand this tutorial, made from [ProgrammingKnowledge](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgrammingKnowledge), [link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcP0Du4KFSU)
