## Topics

Here is an index of the topics covered (inspired by <https://roadmap.sh/python/>):

### Grundlagen

#### Einige Fragen zu Python

- **Warum?** Because of its flexybility python can be used in every field you may need: from the simplest programs to data science and machine learning.

- **Was?** Python is a programming language born in the '90s, but became popular only later. It's an **interpreted** language, which means that an intepreter (embedded with python installation packages) will "read" line by line the code and execute it, it's very easy to understand and use and can be the basis to learn any other programming language.

- **Woher?** Python programs can be developed from the embedded IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) which is IDLE or, as in this course, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Wie?** By the end of this course you will have an understanding of what programming means and some little project built with step-by-step guides.

#### Variablen und Datentyp  

 **What is a variable?** Let's think it as a drawer (_our variable_), which has a label on it (_the variable name_), in this drawer you can put "things" (_our information_) and unless you remove the things from the drawer they will stay in it.

 Making it real a **variable** is a space area in our computer where we can store information useful to our program.

 In Python the syntax to create a variable is:

 ```python

 x=1

 ```

 Our variables can be defined as some data-types. We can divide the data-types in two big categories:

 **Primitive.** These data-type are the fundamental ones they are **integer** (which defines all the integer numbers), **float** (which defines floating point numbers), **complex** (which defines complex numbers, with j as the imaginary part), **boolean** (which defines 0 [false] or 1 [true] values used for logical and boolean operations), **str** (which defines all the text types).

 Here a list of how to define every data-type seen above:

 ```python

 x=int(255)  #integer

 x=float(1.00)  #floating point

 w=complex(5+3j)  #complex

 x=bool(true) #boolean

 x=str('this is a string')  #text (or string)

 ```

> Note that this **is not** a necessary operation, in fact Python can
> use variables without assigning them a specific data-type.  Although
> is necessary in some cases.

#### Lists, Dictionaries

Using a variable we can store only 1 information at time, there are some structures in Python that allows us to store multiple information, these strcuctures are called **lists**, here is the syntax to create one

```python
list1=["item1", "item2", "item3"] #string list
intList=[1,2,3,4,5,6] #int list
boolList=[True, False, False] #bool list
mixed=["item",1,True] #lists can contain also mixed types
```  

> As you can se it's like creating a variable but we have to use the
> square brackets **[]** to define the elements separated them with the comma
> **,**  

A list has these 3 characteristics:

1. Ordered  
 ‚Ü≥ Lists are ordered, that means that if you add an element it will be added at the end of our list
2. Changeable  
 ‚Ü≥ This means that we can **add**, **change**, **remove** items from the list after creating it
3. Duplicates  
 ‚Ü≥ Since lists have indexes we can have duplicated values  
In order to access items of a list we can use this syntax:

```python
list1[1] #access to the element in position 1 (2)
```

> Note that to count positions of the items we start from **0**, so the first item of the _intList_ will be ```intList[0]=>1```

#### Casting

A fatal operation in programming is **casting**, what does that mean? It means to force a data-type into another one, let me explain...
Imagine having a division between to float values and you want only to have the integer value of the quotient, here is how you do that!

 ```python
 x=float(250)
 y=float(256)
 div=int(x/y)

 ```

> Note that you **cannot** cast a data-type into any other one, for some
> data-types you need some **functions** (_like parsing_).

#### If, For & While  

**What if I want to make my program go in different paths based on some event?**
To do so we use **IF** conditions, if conditions are mathematical and logical expressions that return only two possible values:

 1. True (1)
 2. False (0)

Let's say we want to check what is the bigger number between 10 and 9, here  is the syntax:

```python
a=9
b=10
if(a>b):
  print("9 is grater than 10")
else
  print("10 is grater than 9")
```

> Note that in this case the outcome of the espression is "false" so the only code executed will be the one after the "else"

Here is a list of the operators we can use in the if clause:
| Mathematical | Logical |
|--------------|---------|
| `<` _(less than)_            | `and` _(returns true only if both are true)_ |
| `>` _(grater than)_        | `or` _(returns true if at least one is true)_ |
| `<=` _(less or euqal to)_        | `not` _(negates the boolean expression, if true becomes false)_ |
| `>=`  _(grater or equal to)_       |  |
| `==` _(equal to)_       |  |
| `!=` _(not equal to)_       |  |  

**If I have to repeat a small (or big) portion of code a certain numbers of times?**  
In order to do that we can use **FOR** loops that allows us to repeat portions of code a specific amount of times by specifying an index (i), here is the syntax:

```python
for i in range(100): #this loop prints the first 100 numbers
  print(i)
```  

You can also specify a range of values, like this:

```python
for i in range(50,100): #this loop prints the numbers from 50 to 100 
  print(i)
```  

**Lastly, if I don't know how many times i have to repeat my loop?**  
Possibly you will have a condition that will stop your loop, loops structured this way are called **WHILE** loops, here is thier syntax:  

```python
while(x>10):
  x+=1
  print(x)
```
